            The history of the rose shields starts not long after Guido joined the CIPsoft 
            team, the Gods decided to bless the oldest guilds of Tibia. Red Rose together with 
            only other two guilds (the Mercenarys and Kaerell) were offered to design their 
            own armor pieces. While the Red Rose designed the Rose shield and the Rose armor, 
            the Mercenarys and Kaerell just designed shields.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Red Rose was the only guild to unlock (buy) both items as far as it's known. 
            The price was ( 200.000 gp - 100 Backpacks full of gold coins ) which, during those 
            days it was a lot and for more context, there were no platinum or crystal coins. 
            The full amount was paid to CIP at the Thais harbour and every single backpack was 
            thrown into the water, one by one, by the Cip team.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Roses Genesis SE (aka Tharanis) and our leader back then, Lightbringer, designed 
            the two rose masterpieces. Especially in the shield, Genesis SE made the Rose for 
            the inside of the shield, and Lightbringer created the background and border contour. 
            The Gods then created these beautiful shields and armors for the Red Rose. 
            (Fun fact: Lightbringer had to ask the Gods each time and a God would appear to him 
            and create one shield or armor.)
          </p>
          <p>
            The total number of shields created is a mistery, since the file keeping the 
            shield/owner was lost long ago. It's known that at least shields for the next members 
            were created: 
          </p>

              <li>

                Virgel
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            About one year later, the Gods thought that it was unfair to the rest of the inhabitants 
            of Tibia to make such difference by giving this three guilds more than to the rest, and 
            proceeded to destroy these magnificent pieces. Thats how the Rose shields lost it's 
            original ""RR"" mark, the Rose armor became the actual Noble armor and the shields for 
            the Mercenarys and the other guild were turned into the Griffin and Ancient shields 
            respectively, which can be obtained in-game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on this research, we have found out that all the remaining shields are (and most 
            probably will always be) inside the guild. From the original 8, we know that 5 of them 
            are still among our ranks. There are 2 more that are supposed to be among our ranks, 
            based on the last conversation held with those owners and one is confirmed to have been 
            deleted (together with the account of the owner, due to prolonged inactivity). Still 
            nowadays, the Rose shield is not lootable nor obtainable through any quest.

          About the famous and questionable Demon Powere Shield and its relation with 
          Lightbringer from Red Rose.

          <p>
            Back in the days, when only a few kind of shields existed, there was an amazingly 
            powerful piece, called the Demon Powered Shield. The existing shields in this time 
            were the Dragon shield, the Mastermind shield, and the Demon powered shield, nothing 
            else. This shield had 50 def points, while the Mastermind had 40 (Blessed shield 
            didn't exist at this time). Also it wielded around 5 attack points.
          </p>
          <p>
            One day Lightbringer decided to get himself one of them, only 3 or 4 existed, and 
            as he asked around, he came through the Game Master "Ender Speaker for the Dead". 
            This Game Master had one, and decided to sell it to Lightbringer. The price was 
            150.000 gold pieces, which nowadays is barely nothing. But back in the day, long 
            before the platinum coins were introduced, 150.000 gp were literally 150k golden 
            pieces (75 backpacks filled with golden coins!).
          </p>
          <p>
            Lightbringer was already pretty well known, so the Game Master gave him credit, 
            letting him pay 80.000gp flat, and the rest over the following weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            To clarify some things, these shields were meant to be unaccesible. There should be 
            only one of these shields, laying inside an unaccessible area inside a trasure box. 
            This area was accessed through some bugs, and the shield was taken, then duped a 
            few times. 
          </p>
          <p>
            A few weeks after Lightbringer bought the shield, maybe a month, Cipsoft found out 
            these shields were in the hands of players, identified them, and pretty much deleted 
            everyone who had the shields in their possesion. Everyone besides Lightbringer, 
            since he could prove that he wasn't the one that "stole" it... As he bought the 
            shield from a GM. So Guido spawned and forced Lightbringer throwing the shield in 
            the sea, getting nothing in return, neither the 150.000 gp which was an incredibly 
            amount of money back then. Lightbringer says he did never used this shield.
          </p>
          <p>
            So deep in the oceans surrounding the continents of Tibia, there is still, a mighty 
            treasure from the past...
