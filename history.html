            The history of the rose shields starts not long after Guido joined the CIPsoft 
            team, the Gods decided to bless the oldest guilds of Tibia. Red Rose together with 
            only other two guilds (the Mercenarys and Kaerell) were offered to design their 
            own armor pieces. While the Red Rose designed the Rose shield and the Rose armor, 
            the Mercenarys and Kaerell just designed shields.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Red Rose was the only guild to unlock (buy) both items as far as it's known. 
            The price was ( 200.000 gp - 100 Backpacks full of gold coins ) which, during those 
            days it was a lot and for more context, there were no platinum or crystal coins. 
            The full amount was paid to CIP at the Thais harbour and every single backpack was 
            thrown into the water, one by one, by the Cip team.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Roses Genesis SE (aka Tharanis) and our leader back then, Lightbringer, designed 
            the two rose masterpieces. Especially in the shield, Genesis SE made the Rose for 
            the inside of the shield, and Lightbringer created the background and border contour. 
            The Gods then created these beautiful shields and armors for the Red Rose. 
            (Fun fact: Lightbringer had to ask the Gods each time and a God would appear to him 
            and create one shield or armor.)
          </p>
          <p>
            The total number of shields created is a mistery, since the file keeping the 
            shield/owner was lost long ago. It's known that at least shields for the next members 
            were created:

              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            About one year later, the Gods thought that it was unfair to the rest of the inhabitants 
            of Tibia to make such difference by giving this three guilds more than to the rest, and 
            proceeded to destroy these magnificent pieces. Thats how the Rose shields lost it's 
            original ""RR"" mark, the Rose armor became the actual Noble armor and the shields for 
            the Mercenarys and the other guild were turned into the Griffin and Ancient shields 
            respectively, which can be obtained in-game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on this research, we have found out that all the remaining shields are (and most 
            probably will always be) inside the guild. From the original 8, we know that 5 of them 
            are still among our ranks. There are 2 more that are supposed to be among our ranks, 
            based on the last conversation held with those owners and one is confirmed to have been 
            deleted (together with the account of the owner, due to prolonged inactivity). Still 
            nowadays, the Rose shield is not lootable nor obtainable through any quest.
