            We are a group/clan of players of Tibia MMORPG, one of the oldest and most 
            successful massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG) created 
            in Europe. In an MMORPG people from all over the world meet on a virtual 
            playground to explore areas, solve tricky riddles and undertake heroic exploits. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Red Rose is an ancient guild of Good, followers of Banor. We are peaceloving 
            and try to uphold law and noble virtues, but like the rose we have sharp thorns, 
            too! - Founded December 7th 1998 - - Proud winner of the first ever Tibian 
            Football League.

          <h2>
            What about the Rose Shields?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The history of the rose shields starts not long after Guido joined the CIPsoft 
            team, the Gods decided to bless the oldest guilds of Tibia. Red Rose together 
            with only other two guilds (the Mercenarys and a long vanished guild) were offered 
            to design their own armor pieces. The Red Rose designed the Rose shield and the 
            Rose armor, the Mercenarys and the other guild (the name of the guild, according 
            to the Nightmare Knights history site was Kreal) designed shields.  
          </p>
          <p>
            The complete history of these shields can be found on the history section of 
            this website.
