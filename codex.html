          <h2>
            What about the Rose Shields?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The history of the rose shields starts not long after Guido joined the CIPsoft 
            team, the Gods decided to bless the oldest guilds of Tibia. Red Rose together 
            with only other two guilds (the Mercenarys and a long vanished guild) were offered 
            to design their own armor pieces. The Red Rose designed the Rose shield and the 
            Rose armor, the Mercenarys and the other guild (the name of the guild, according 
            to the Nightmare Knights history site was Kreal) designed shields.  
          </p>
          <p>
            The Roses Genesis SE (nowadays known as Tharanis) and our leader back then, 
            Lightbringer, designed the two rose masterpieces. Especially in the shield, Genesis 
            SE made the Rose for the inside of the shield, and Lightbringer created the 
            background and border contour. The Gods then created these beautiful shields and 
            armors for the Red Rose; Lightbringer had to ask the Gods each time, and a God would 
            appear to him and create one shield or armor. The total number of shields created 
            is a mistery, since the file keeping the shield/owner was lost long ago. It's known 
            that at least shields for: Lightbringer, Genesis SE, Octavian, Firehawk, Beowulf, 
            Virgel, Silvarion and Eickman; were created. 
          </p>
          <p>
            About one year later, the Gods thought that it was unfair to the rest of the 
            inhabitants of Tibia to make such difference by giving this three guilds more than 
            to the rest, and proceeded to destroy these magnificent pieces. Thats how the Rose 
            shields lost it's original "RR" mark, the Rose armor became the actual Noble armor 
            (a level 35 quest), and the shields for the Mercenarys and the other guild, were 
            turned into the Griffin and Ancient shields respectively. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the shields are and will always be inside the guild, even if two are 
            confirmed to have been deleted (together with the account of the owners, due to 
            prolonged inactivity), and at least one is lost around Antica. Still nowadays, 
            the Rose shield is not lootable nor obtainable through any quest.
